## How to run this application

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Setup mysql database from config/receipt_tracker.sql
3. Configure your .env file according to the sample .env called env.sample, which has the following fields:-
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./config/cred.json (this will be your Goolge Vision API credentials, in case you want to use this. This is highly reommended for higher accuracy but its chargeable)
   APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 (change the url and port as per your choosing)
   APP_API_PORT=3000
   APP_URL=http://localhost:3001 (this is the react frontend url and port, which needs to change as per your setting)
   GROQ_API_KEY = You need to add a groq API key here. This will be used to parse the extrated text from vision api to generate a JSON file
   GROQ_API_BASE_URL= https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
   MYSQL_DB_USERNAME=receipt_tracker - change this as needed
   MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD=receipt_tracker - change this as needed
   MYSQL_DB_NAME=receipt_tracker - change this as needed
   UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads - this is the folder which all the processed receipts will be uploaded

## Unit tests
Only postman tests have been carried out and there are no unit test routines with this code. 

## AI models used
Google Vision API - For extraction of receipt data from the images
Tesseract.js - For extraction of receipt data from the images
Groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile - For extraction of relevant information in a structured JSON files from the output of vision models

## Future todos and improvements 
a. Groq API timeouts
b. More vision model exploration to reduce cost from Google api calls
c. Hosting LLama/other free language and vision models on bedrock
d. Saving receiptsÂ and data on s3
e. Authentication
f. Duplicate reciept rejection
g. More swagger details for APIs
